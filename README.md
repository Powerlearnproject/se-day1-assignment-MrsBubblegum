#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
*Software Engineering is the art and science of designing, building and maintaning software solutions that solve real-world problems. The importance of software engineering is crucial because software is the backbone of the modern world. Without it, our favorite apps, secure banking systems and even online learning platforms wouldn't exist.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
* (1)The Birth of Software Engineering (1968):
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference. This milestone marked the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline due to the "software crisis" — a period where projects were plagued by cost overruns, missed deadlines, and low-quality software. This conference led to the establishment of structured programming practices and the need for formal methodologies in software development.

(2)The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s):
The development of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like Smalltalk and later C++ revolutionized how software was designed and built. OOP introduced concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. This shift addressed the growing complexity of software systems and laid the foundation for modern software development.

(3)Agile Manifesto and Modern Methodologies (2001):
The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 marked a major shift from traditional, rigid software development methods (like the Waterfall model) to more flexible, iterative approaches. Agile emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback, enabling faster delivery of functional software. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban have since become widely adopted in the industry.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
* (1) Idea generation - This is the foundation of the project where goals, scope, requirements, timelines, and resources are defined. Feasibility studies and risk assessments are often conducted here.
  (2) Requirement analysis - In this phase, detailed requirements are collected from stakeholders. This includes functional (what the software should do) and non-functional (performance, security) requirements. Clear documentation is created to avoid misunderstandings later.
  (3) Product design - The system architecture and design specifications are created here. High-level design covers overall system architecture, while low-level design focuses on detailed module and component design. Tools like flowcharts and UML diagrams are often used.
  (4) Product development - This is where actual coding happens. Developers write the code based on the design documents, following coding standards and using the chosen programming languages and tools.
  (5) Integration & testing - The software is tested for bugs, performance issues, and compliance with the requirements. Various testing methods like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing are conducted.
  (6) Deployment - Once the software passes testing, it’s released to the production environment. This could be done in phases (like a pilot launch) or all at once, depending on the deployment strategy.
  (7) Maintenance - After deployment, the software is monitored for issues. Updates, bug fixes, and enhancements are made to keep the system efficient and aligned with user needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
* Key Differences:
-Waterfall is best for well-defined projects with stable requirements.
-Agile is ideal for projects where requirements might evolve over time.

Waterfall Methodology:
Structure: Linear and sequential — each phase (like planning, design, development, testing, deployment) happens one after the other. You can’t go back to a previous phase once it’s done.
Flexibility: Very rigid — changes are hard to implement once development starts.
Documentation: Heavy documentation — everything is planned and documented upfront.
Timeline: Longer — the final product is delivered at the end of the project.
Involvement: Minimal customer involvement after the requirements phase.
Example Scenario:
Construction of an Airport Management System
Let’s say a government wants to build a software system to manage airport operations — like flight scheduling, baggage handling, security checks, and passenger information. This approach ensures a well-structured, stable, and highly reliable system, which is critical in environments like airports where safety and accuracy are non-negotiable.

Agile Methodology:
Structure: Iterative and flexible — work is divided into short “sprints” (1-4 weeks), and progress is continuously reviewed and adjusted.
Flexibility: Highly adaptable — you can easily change features based on feedback.
Documentation: Lighter documentation — more focus on working software and frequent updates.
Timeline: Faster — functional parts of the software are delivered frequently.
Involvement: High customer involvement throughout the process, with frequent feedback.
Example Scenario:
Developing a mobile app where user feedback drives updates and feature changes. Agile allows you to respond quickly to market demands.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* The role of a Software Developer is to write and maintain the code that makes the software work. They turn project requirements into a functional product. Some of their responsibilities include : Develop, test, and debug code based on project specifications, collaborate with designers, analysts, and other developers, review and optimize code for performance and scalability, and maintain documentation of code and technical processes.
* The role of a Quality Assurance Engineer is to ensure the software meets quality standards and works as expected without bugs or performance issues. Some of their responsibilities are : Design and execute test plans, including manual and automated testing, identify, document, and report bugs or issues and verify that new features meet the requirements and do not break existing functionality.
* A Project manager's role is to overses the entire project to ensure it’s delivered on time, within scope, and within budget. Their responsibilities include : Define project goals, scope, and timelines, create and manage project plans and schedules, coordinate between teams (developers, QA, designers, stakeholders), monitor progress and address roadblocks, manage risks and changes in project scope and most importantly, ensure clear communication and alignment across the team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
*Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Importance: An IDE is a software application that provides tools to write, edit, debug, and manage code all in one place. It boosts productivity by offering features like syntax highlighting, code completion, error detection, and integrated debugging.
Examples:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Lightweight and highly customizable, great for web development and various programming languages.
PyCharm: Specifically designed for Python, with powerful debugging and testing tools.

*Version Control Systems (VCS):
Importance: A VCS tracks and manages changes to code over time. It lets developers collaborate without overwriting each other’s work, roll back to previous versions if issues arise, and maintain a history of code changes.
Examples:
Git: The most widely used VCS, allowing for distributed version control and used with platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
Subversion (SVN): A centralized VCS often used in enterprise settings for large projects.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges and strategies to tackle them:
(1) Unclear or Changing Requirements:
Challenge: Stakeholders might not always know exactly what they want, or requirements change mid-project.
Strategy: Use Agile methodologies for flexibility, maintain regular communication with stakeholders, and document requirements clearly. Tools like Jira or Trello can help manage changes and priorities.
(2) Managing Technical Debt:
Challenge: Rushed development or poor design decisions can lead to messy code that’s hard to maintain.
Strategy: Prioritize writing clean, modular code and refactor regularly. Use code reviews and automated tests to maintain quality.
(3) Time Management and Deadlines:
Challenge: Balancing multiple tasks while meeting project deadlines can be overwhelming.
Strategy: Break work into manageable chunks using time management techniques like the Pomodoro method (a time management method that involves working in 25-minute intervals, called pomodoros, with short breaks in between). Prioritize tasks with tools like Asana or Notion and set realistic expectations.
(4) Debugging and Troubleshooting:
Challenge: Finding and fixing bugs, especially in complex systems, can take time and patience.
Strategy: Use systematic debugging techniques, like reproducing the issue, checking logs, and isolating problem areas. IDEs with powerful debugging tools (like Visual Studio Code) can help.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
(1) Unit testing: Tests individual components or functions of the software (like a specific method or class) in isolation. Catches bugs early and makes code easier to maintain and refactor.
(2) Integration testing: Tests how different modules or components of the software work together. Detects issues in the interaction between modules, reducing the risk of integration failures.
(3) System testing: Tests the entire system as a whole to verify it meets specified requirements. Validates the behavior of the entire system and ensures all features work together properly.
(4) Acceptance testing: Confirms whether the software meets business requirements and user expectations. Verifies that the software delivers the intended value and works as expected for users.

*Using all these testing types together helps catch different kinds of issues at various stages of development, leading to higher-quality, more reliable software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
*Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining the input (or "prompt") given to an AI model to achieve the most accurate, useful and relevant output. It involves crafting questions, instructions or context in a way that guides the AI’s response effectively.

Why It’s Important:
-Enhances AI Performance: A well-structured prompt can lead to clearer, more accurate, and more insightful responses from the AI.
-Improves Efficiency: It reduces the need for multiple follow-up questions by getting the right answer on the first try.
-Tailors AI Behavior: The way a prompt is framed can influence the tone, detail, and style of the AI’s output — like making responses more formal, creative, technical, or concise.
-Solves Complex Problems: Good prompts help AI handle nuanced or multi-step tasks more effectively.
-Reduces Ambiguity: Clear and specific prompts minimize misunderstanding and ensure the AI knows exactly what’s being asked.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: “Explain programming.” - Too broad, likely gets a generic response.
Refined Prompt: “Explain the importance of object-oriented programming in modern software development, with real-world examples.” - Clearer, more focused and results in a more detailed and relevant answer.
